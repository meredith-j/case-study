To run code:
- install dependencies (npm i)
- add input csv file (file has been added to .gitignore to keep company information private)

- add a csv file to the input folder. This file should be called "case-study-data.csv" in order for the function to work properly.

input .csv file should have the following columns in order to run properly:

Model Number  | Device Number | Colour  | Size | Price |
